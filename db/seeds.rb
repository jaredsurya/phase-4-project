# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# https://www.superheroapi.com/api.php/165372752915293/732
# superhero API with 732 characters 
# randomly generate 20 of them and add selected data into database
# every superhero has many reviews and many users through reviews

# my app has a user log in
# once logged in the user can see their team selection of (5) heroes displayed
# user can edit their selection of 5 by picking from 25 randomly generated heroes (superheroapi.com)
# users team is ranked by overall strength and sorted in a list with other users' teams
# users can leave comments on other users' teams, edit and delete comments as well
