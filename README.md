# Superhero Team Builder

## Description

This project is a single page application made to fulfill the requirements of Flatiron School. During phase 4 of my time studying with them we learned how to use Ruby on Rails as an API backend, paired with a react frontend. I chose to make my project about superheroes and found a very useful site, superheroapi.com, for seeding my databases with characters. 

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7.4
- NodeJS (v16), and npm

See Setup below for instructions on installing these tools if you
don't already have them.
